# CONTRIBUTING

Contributions are very welcome, and are accepted via pull requests. Please review these guidelines before submitting any pull requests.

## Guidelines

* Please follow the [PSR-2 Coding Standard](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md) and [PHP-FIG Naming Conventions](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/bylaws/002-psr-naming-conventions.md) Style-CI runs on every PR so you can fetch the necessary style changes from there.
* Ensure that the current tests pass, and add more tests if you have added logic.

If the test suites pass on your local machine you should be good to go.

When you make a pull request, the tests will automatically be run again by [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) on multiple php versions.
